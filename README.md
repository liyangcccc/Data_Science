Detail Description:
•	Assign the 'trading' label as a buy/sell signal for each week. Split the data into training set and testing set.
•	Train several classifier model to predict labels and plot the portfolio growth for each one:
•	Built a Minkowski kNN model strategies with k=3 based on volatility and delta difference between the opening and closing price. The accuracy is 0.56;
•	Used SHapley Additive exPlanations(SHAP) Feature Explanations to attribute accuracy for logistic regression, Euclidean kNN and linear model to compute the contribution of μ and σ;
•	Implement LDA with accuracy 0.96 and QDA classifier with accuracy 0.83;
•	Developed a Random Forest Classifier, plot error rate to determine the number of trees(N) and max depth(d);
•	Implement a linear SVM with accuracy 0.9, Gaussian SVM with accuracy 0.9 and polynomial SVM.
